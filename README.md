## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project allowed me to significantly strengthen my CSS skills, particularly in Flexbox and CSS Grid for building complex, structured layouts. 

It was my first realistic web development project, requiring the creation of a fully responsive landing page optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop. 

The project also provided an opportunity to apply and consolidate core HTML and CSS fundamentals in a practical, real-world context, reinforcing my understanding of responsive design and layout techniques.
